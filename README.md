# ion-selectivity-GUI
A GUI for users to link analog voltage signals to Nernstian potentials for ion selective electrodes


REQUIRES:
1. Matlab 2020b+
2. Data Acquisition Toolbox (4.2)
3. Data Acquisition Toolbox Support Package for National Instruments NI-DAQmx Devices (20.2.0)
4. NI-DAQmx drivers from LabVIEW website (ni.com)


# Background
This repo was created with the intention to explore trans-membrane ion selectivity in retinal pigment epithelial cells. Thus we needed a GUI that was simple to use, and could be easily reconfigured for a variety of exeriments intended to determine the activity of particular ions in the apical and basolateral bath.
